# 2017-entelect-challenge-visualizer
Basic visualizer for the 2017 Entelect Challenge.

This is a Java application that I quickly hacked together in order to help me test and debug my bot for the 2017 Entelect Challenge.  See here: https://challenge.entelect.co.za/

This is not well-tested, production-ready code - it's just a morning's worth of hacking - so use at your own risk.  Feel free to make it better.

#Build and Run

Build: mvn clean install
Run: java -cp Visualizer.jar;lib\* za.co.rfn.Visualizer "<path to dir>"
